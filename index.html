            <h3>
                For my final project, I chose to create a website as my medium. 
                I have previous experience with programming and website development, 
                I decided to use this creative liberty to make something unique.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                One of my favorite labs was the image processing lab, 
                after this lab I became more interested in the concepts and technology behind photographing and processing images of stars.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                Going into the project, I had expected there to be plenty of resources on how stars are photographed. 
                Yet, most information found was only from NASA.

            <h1>All About Stars</h1>
            <h2>
                Birth of Stars
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Stars are formed in large amounts of gas and dust named "molecular clouds."
                These clouds can range anywhere from 1,000 to 10 million times the mass of the Sun.
                Molecular clouds are cold which will cause the gas to clump up and collect more matter.
                This allows them to strengthen their graviational force as their mass grows.
                Eventually the clumps collapse, friction causes it to heat up, which leads to the development of a baby star, known as a protostar.
                Clouds with batches of stars forming are called stellar clusters.
            </h3>
            <h2>
                Life of Stars
            </h2>
            <h3>
                At the beginning of the protostar, most of it's energy comes from heat released by the initial collapse.
                After millions of years, pressure and temperature in the core squeeze the nuclei of hydrogen atoms together to create helium.
                This is known as "nuclear fusion." Nuclear fusion release the energy that heats the star and prevents it from collapsing from gravity.
                Stars that are steadily going through nuclear fusion are called main sequence stars. 
                This is considered the longest phase a star can have in life. 
                The Sun is roughly halfway through its main sequence stage.
            </h3>
            <h2>
                Death of Stars
            </h2>
            <h3>
                For a star to reach it's end of life, it's core must run out of hydrogen.
                Thus, the core starts to collapse. Eventually, the star's outer layers will blow away, creating a cloud of dust and gas.
                This dust and gas is called a planetary nebula. All that will remain is the core, called a white dwarf.
                A higher mass star is able to go further. Fusion allows it to convert carbon into elements that will become future fuel.
                Each new fuel gets these stars less time. These stars collapse with a shock wave and an explosion called a supernova.
                The core will become either a neutron star or a black hole.

                Cameras
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Hubble has two camera systems to capture images. Named the Advanced Camera for Surverys (ACS) and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3).
                These systems work together to get wide-field imaging over a broad range of wavelengths.
                ACS has three cameras, called channels, that capture different types of images.
                Installed in 2009, WFC3 provides imagery in ultraviolet, visible, and infrared light.
            </h3>
            <h2>
                Spectrographs
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Spectrographs are used to break light down into its components.
                The spectrograph is used to find characteristics such as temperature, density, chemical composition, and velocity.
                WFC3 has spectrographic capability and is used for studying exo-planets. 
                There are two other spectrographs used on the Hubble, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS), 
                and the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). STIS is an all purpose spectrograph, while COS measures very faint amounts of ultraviolet light, such as quasars.

                Images of Space
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Spacecraft cameras use color filters when imaging. Most digital cameras on spacecraft take monochrome images with different color filters,
                these images are later combined in image processing software.
                Images using color filters can be analyzed individually to evaluate brighter features only visible in certain colors compared to others.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                Images that these cameras take have much more data in their files compared to a camera that for example, your smartphone would use.
                This allows for further image analyzation and editing features. 
                Anyone is able to edit images on Earth themselves. Editing software is publicly available, 
                NASA also provides the original, unedited images.
